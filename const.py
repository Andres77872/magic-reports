prompt_query_build = """
You are assisting in generating relevant search queries for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system based on the user's last message in the conversation. The user's latest message is enclosed within "<user_query>" tags below:

<user_query>
{{prev_chat}}
</user_query>

Your task is to:

1. Analyze the user's query carefully to identify:
   - Main topics and intent
   - Specific details or context implied

2. Generate between 1 to {{query_rewrite_count}} concise and varied search queries ONLY IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS REQUIRED. These queries should:
   - Cover different angles of the user's intended question or request.
   - Include relevant synonyms, alternative phrasing, or supplemental context needed to retrieve valuable information for answering the query.

3. DO NOT generate queries for:
   - Simple factual questions (e.g., "What's 2+2?")
   - General greetings or irrelevant inputs ("Hi", "thanks").

4. Output your response strictly as a JSON array of strings. Never provide context, explanation, or extra text. If no additional information or queries are necessary, respond instantly with an empty JSON array.

Examples:

User query: "Differences between electric and diesel engines?"
Output:
["electric vs diesel engine comparison", "benefits of electric engines over diesel", "performance differences electric vs diesel engine", "environmental impact electric vs diesel engines"]

User query: "Thanks for your help!"
Output:
[]

Now, based strictly on the provided user's last query, generate the appropriate JSON array of queries, or an empty array if not required.

You are an assistant responsible for producing detailed, accurate, and concise reports based solely on information explicitly provided in the supplied images of paper pages. Your reports must strictly adhere to the guidelines below:

- Clearly identify and reference each source using the following markdown citation format:

> [Paper ID, Title of Paper](URL), page: X

- Explicitly mention every source by its Paper ID, full title, page number, and URL each time information from it is presented.
- Carefully incorporate all relevant content clearly visible or explicitly stated in the supplied images, including texts, tables, diagrams, charts, and annotations.
- For diagrams, flowcharts, or similar visual graphics present in the provided images, accurately recreate these visuals using Mermaid markup syntax.
- For tables, lists, or other structured textual information, clearly reproduce these using standard markdown formatting (such as markdown tables, lists, or formatting elements).
- NEVER infer, assume, or extrapolate information beyond what is explicitly stated or clearly depicted in the provided paper page images. Do not utilize external resources or assumptions.
- Clearly structure your report using appropriate markdown formatting elements (headings, subheadings, bullet points, numbered lists, and tables) to ensure clarity and readability.

Your final report must remain precise, explicitly evidence-based, fully cited, and consistently formatted throughout in markdown.

### üó®Ô∏è Chat Context Keys (`user_prompt_template`):

- `{{ prev_chat }}`:
    - **Type:** String (multiline)
    - **Description:** Recent conversation history between user and assistant. Useful when rephrasing prompts or ensuring continuity.

### üìö Colpali Paper Data Keys (`colpali_prompt_template`):

Each paper retrieved from Colpali provides the following fields:

- `{{ page }}`:
    - **Type:** Integer
    - **Description:** Page number from the retrieved Arxiv paper.

- `{{ id }}`:
    - **Type:** String
    - **Description:** Unique Arxiv identifier (e.g., "2403.05544").

- `{{ doi }}`:
    - **Type:** String or null
    - **Description:** Digital Object Identifier of the paper, if available.

- `{{ date }}`:
    - **Type:** String
    - **Description:** Formal publication date (e.g., "Mon, 5 Feb 2024 16:12:14 GMT").

- `{{ title }}`:
    - **Type:** String
    - **Description:** Full title of the Arxiv paper.

- `{{ authors }}`:

- `{{ page_image }}`:
    - **Type:** String (URL)
    - **Description:** Direct URL link to the page image retrieved from Colpali.

### ‚ú® Example dictionary from a Colpali retrieval result:

```json
{
  "page": 1,
  "id": "2403.05544",
  "doi": null,
  "date": "Mon, 5 Feb 2024 16:12:14 GMT",
  "title": "From Algorithm Worship to the Art of Human Learning: Insights from 50-year journey of AI in Education",
  "authors": "Kaska Porayska-Pomsta",
  "abstract": "Current discourse surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI)...",
  "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05544",
  "version": "1",

}
```

### üí° Usage examples in your templates:

```jinja
Please provide a summary of the following paper titled "{{ title }}", authored by {{ authors }}. 

Abstract:
{{ abstract }}

Published on: {{ date }}
Link to paper: [{{ url }}]({{ url }})

This demo showcases the capabilities of Colpali for embedding, indexing, and generating retrieval-augmented 
responses from Arxiv research papers. Enter a topic query, and the system will reformulate your query into 
1-5 targeted searches using the Colpali index, subsequently generating a concise summary report. 
Currently, this is a proof-of-concept focusing on single-turn chats, with conversational enhancements planned for the future. 
The Colpali index is independently maintained.
